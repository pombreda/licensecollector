= Introduction =

Many programming projects rely on other libraries or modules. E.g. when embedding open source libraries a proper release documentation must be created where the requirements of the licences are met.

In a larger teams where deadlines are to be met, you can easily loose sight of which 3rd party library was imported into your project.

This small tool is an ANT task that generates a html file in which all integrated 3rd party libraries are listed with their license specification and acknowlegdements.

Of course this feature does not come completey for free, the developer has to adhere to a proposed standard information sheet when integrating/commiting libraries, but then this small tool will render a nice Third Party License Term List, and your legal counsel will be happy.


= Details =

Introduce the task into your antfile
{{{
<taskdef name="lcollector" classname="org.fluidops.ant.task.LicenseCollectorTask" classpath="lcollector.jar"/>
}}}

Then run your task with
{{{
<lcollector 
  libraryFolder="${root}/lib" 
  licenseFolder="${root}/licenses" 
  htmlTemplate="${root}/licenses/mytemplate.html"
  outputFile="${root}/3rdparty.html"
/>
}}}

The parameters are as follows:
  *  libraryFolder: root folder of libraries, start for recursive search for .lic files
  *  licenseFolder: folder in which the plain license files are located
  *  outputFile:	   the file path of the rendered html file 
  *  htmpTemplate:  optional, a customized html template

A .lic file looks like this (property file with key-value pairs):
{{{
#An example license
Date=2004-2009
License_Type=Apache Software License 2.0
Licensor=The Apache Foundation
Description=Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is kind of like make, without make's wrinkles.
Library=apache-ant
Acknowledgements=see Notice.txt
}}}

The License_Type denotes the type of the license and in the rendering process the tool looks for a file called %License_Type%.license in the specified licenseFolder.
