<div style="width:650px;">
	<h2>Preamble</h2>
	<p>
	ACME incorporates third party software, e.g. from the open source community, in their software products.
	The license terms associated with these software libraries or modules require that we give copyright and license information, 
	and this Third Party License Terms List ("TPLTL") provides those details.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The third party software used are primarily libraries for the java virtual machine environment, as well as the java runtime environment itself.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As many of the licenses share common terms rather than repeat the same text ad nauseam, 
	we summarize those licenses and their respective usage. For unique licenses, we have provided the full license text.
