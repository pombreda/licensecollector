<h1>Third Party License Terms List</h1>
</div>

<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>
ACME incorporates third party software, e.g. from the open source community, in their software products.
The license terms associated with these software libraries or modules require that we give copyright and license information, 
and this Third Party License Terms List ("TPLTL") provides those details.
</p>

<p>
The third party software used are primarily libraries for the java virtual machine environment, as well as the java runtime environment itself.
</p>

<p>
As many of the licenses share common terms rather than repeat the same text ad nauseam, 
we summarize those licenses and their respective usage. For unique licenses, we have provided the full license text.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. Binary Code License Agreement

for the JAVA SE RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT (JRE) VERSION 6

SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. ("SUN") IS WILLING TO LICENSE THE
SOFTWARE IDENTIFIED BELOW TO YOU ONLY UPON THE CONDITION
THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS BINARY
CODE LICENSE AGREEMENT AND SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS
(COLLECTIVELY "AGREEMENT").  PLEASE READ THE AGREEMENT
CAREFULLY.  BY DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU
ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT. INDICATE ACCEPTANCE BY
SELECTING THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BE BOUND BY ALL THE
TERMS, SELECT THE "DECLINE" BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
AGREEMENT AND THE DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL PROCESS WILL NOT
CONTINUE.

1. DEFINITIONS. "Software" means the identified above in
binary form, any other machine readable materials
(including, but not limited to, libraries, source files,
header files, and data files), any updates or error
corrections provided by Sun, and any user manuals,
programming guides and other documentation provided to you
by Sun under this Agreement.  "General Purpose Desktop
Computers and Servers" means computers, including desktop,
laptop and tablet computers, or servers, used for general
computing functions under end user control (such as but not
specifically limited to email, general purpose Internet
browsing, and office suite productivity tools).  The use of
Software in systems and solutions that provide dedicated
functionality (other than as mentioned above) or designed
for use in embedded or function-specific software
applications, for example but not limited to: Software
embedded in or bundled with industrial control systems,
wireless mobile telephones, wireless handheld devices,
kiosks, TV/STB, Blu-ray Disc devices, telematics and
network control switching equipment, printers and storage
management systems, and other related systems are excluded
from this definition and not licensed under this
Agreement.  "Programs" means Java technology applets and
applications intended to run on the Java Platform Standard
Edition (Java SE) platform on Java-enabled General Purpose
Desktop Computers and Servers.

2. LICENSE TO USE. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including, but not limited to the Java
Technology Restrictions of the Supplemental License Terms,
Sun grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited
license without license fees to reproduce and use
internally Software complete and unmodified for the sole
purpose of running Programs. Additional licenses for
developers and/or publishers are granted in the
Supplemental License Terms.

3. RESTRICTIONS. Software is confidential and copyrighted.
Title to Software and all associated intellectual property
rights is retained by Sun and/or its licensors. Unless
enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, you may not
modify, decompile, or reverse engineer Software.  You
acknowledge that Licensed Software is not designed or
intended for use in the design, construction, operation or
maintenance of any nuclear facility. Sun Microsystems, Inc.
disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for
such uses. No right, title or interest in or to any
trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of Sun or its
licensors is granted under this Agreement. Additional
restrictions for developers and/or publishers licenses are
set forth in the Supplemental License Terms.

4. LIMITED WARRANTY.  Sun warrants to you that for a period
of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase, as evidenced
by a copy of the receipt, the media on which Software is
furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and
workmanship under normal use.  Except for the foregoing,
Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and
Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be
at Sun's option to replace Software media or refund the fee
paid for Software. Any implied warranties on the Software
are limited to 90 days. Some states do not allow
limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the
above may not apply to you. This limited warranty gives you
specific legal rights. You may have others, which vary from
state to state.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY
INVALID.

6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED
BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR
ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER
CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE,
EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether
in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise,
exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this
Agreement.  The foregoing limitations will apply even if
the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.
Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or
consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not
be applicable to you.

7. TERMINATION.  This Agreement is effective until
terminated.  You may terminate this Agreement at any time
by destroying all copies of Software.  This Agreement will
terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you fail
to comply with any provision of this Agreement.  Either
party may terminate this Agreement immediately should any
Software become, or in either party's opinion be likely to
become, the subject of a claim of infringement of any
intellectual property right. Upon Termination, you must
destroy all copies of Software.

8. EXPORT REGULATIONS. All Software and technical data
delivered under this Agreement are subject to US export
control laws and may be subject to export or import
regulations in other countries.  You agree to comply
strictly with all such laws and regulations and acknowledge
that you have the responsibility to obtain such licenses to
export, re-export, or import as may be required after
delivery to you.

9. TRADEMARKS AND LOGOS. You acknowledge and agree as
between you and Sun that Sun owns the SUN, SOLARIS, JAVA,
JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET trademarks and all SUN, SOLARIS,
JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET-related trademarks, service
marks, logos and other brand designations ("Sun Marks"),
and you agree to comply with the Sun Trademark and Logo
Usage Requirements currently located at
http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks. Any use you make of
the Sun Marks inures to Sun's benefit.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  If Software is
being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by
a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any
tier), then the Government's rights in Software and
accompanying documentation will be only as set forth in
this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201
through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD
acquisitions).

11. GOVERNING LAW.  Any action related to this Agreement
will be governed by California law and controlling U.S.
federal law.  No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction
will apply.

12. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in
effect with the provision omitted, unless omission would
frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
Agreement will immediately terminate.

13. INTEGRATION.  This Agreement is the entire agreement
between you and Sun relating to its subject matter.  It
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
communications, proposals, representations and warranties
and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of
any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication
between the parties relating to its subject matter during
the term of this Agreement.  No modification of this
Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by
an authorized representative of each party.
